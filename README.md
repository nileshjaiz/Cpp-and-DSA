# 🚀 DSA & C++ Journey 📚 | LeetCode Grind 🧠

Welcome to my **DSA + C++ Prep Repository**!  
This is where I document my hands-on journey through **Data Structures**, **Algorithms**, and **C++ programming** – along with my daily grind on **LeetCode** 🧩.

## 📌 What You'll Find Here

🔹 **C++ Concepts** – Basics to advanced: OOP, STL, pointers, recursion, and more  
🔹 **Data Structures** – Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Stacks, Queues, Heaps, HashMaps, etc.  
🔹 **Algorithms** – Sorting, Searching, Greedy, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, and more  
🔹 **LeetCode Solutions** – Neatly organized problems with optimized code and explanations (when needed)  
🔹 **Notes & Patterns** – Problem-solving techniques, code patterns, and time-space analysis
